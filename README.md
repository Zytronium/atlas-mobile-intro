# atlas-mobile-intro

This is an Expo project created with [`create-expo-app`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/create-expo-app).

## Get started

1. Install dependencies

   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

2. Start the app

   ```bash
    npx expo start
   ```

In the output, you'll find options to open the app in a

- [development build](https://docs.expo.dev/develop/development-builds/introduction/)
- [Android emulator](https://docs.expo.dev/workflow/android-studio-emulator/)
- [iOS simulator](https://docs.expo.dev/workflow/ios-simulator/)
- [Expo Go](https://expo.dev/go), a limited sandbox for trying out app development with Expo

You can start developing by editing the files inside the **app** directory. This project uses [file-based routing](https://docs.expo.dev/router/introduction).

## Get a fresh project

When you're ready, run:

```bash
npm run reset-project
```

This command will move the starter code to the **app-example** directory and create a blank **app** directory where you can start developing.

For the last couple of weeks, I've been getting distracted and having to do 50-80% 
of the project in just 2 days, plus PR, yet I've still managed to keep my streak
of all 100%s. If I can do 30-50% of a project in a single day under pressure 
while being so distracted that I don't even start until 5PM, I can do almost as 
much in a day if I stay focused and pretend my deadline is sooner.

In fact, my personal deadline this week is Monday instead of Wednesday so that
I can have plenty of time for PR, personal projects, and R&R. We'll see if this
plan works out.
